        <h3>Take Covid-19 seriously and make society safer!</h3>
        
        <h2 id="3">Description</h2>
        <p>We are writing about taking Covid-19 more seriously, especially aimed at young adults and teenagers. Because most young people are not in the risk-zone they don't really care about obtaining the virus, but with our campaign we want to teach people why it is important to take the virus more seriously.</p>
        <p>This virus should concern us all because we could be the reason why one of our loved ones loses their life and we might not even know that it was us because sometimes people don't even know that they have the virus. If we ignore the virus then we would also contribute to the spreading of the virus, which could end up killing people.</p>
        <p>The reason why we specifically target young adults and teenagers is because they usually don't care and just wipe it off their shoulder. Then they go out partying without masks and socially distancing and end up infected with the virus.</p>

        <h2 id="4">About us</h2>
        <p>We are a group of people that are concerned about the health of other people and our closest family and friends. So we want to encourage people to follow the recommendations and to stay as safe as possible.</p>
        <p>We target our campaign at young adults and teenagers because they would be the ones to care the least, so we want them to understand this serious situation just like we (also young adults) do. That this pandemic can mean life or death.</p>

        <h2 id="5">FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Why would I care if I obtained the virus and I'm not in the risk-zone?</h3>
                You should care because you are then helping the virus spread to the people that are in the risk-zone and may die because of it.</li>

            <li><h3>What do I do if I get bored of staying inside for weeks upon weeks?</h3>
                Then I would suggest that you choose up to 1-2 people that you can hang out with during the pandemic and if you want to hang out/talk to other friends that you have, you should do it online.</li>

            <li><h3>What does it actually mean to be in the risk-zone?</h3>
                What it means to be in the risk-zone is that you have a higher chance of dying from the virus than people outside of the risk-zone. It is still very possible to die from the virus while outside the risk-zone but very unlikely. Some examples of being in the risk-zone: old age, being pregnant, smoking, drinking (alcohol), weakened immune system.</li>

            <li><h3>How does masks work and how effective are they really?</h3>
                Simply put, the mask will stop you from spreading the virus if you have it, but it wont 100% stop you from obtaining the virus. Covid-19 particles can land on your mask, forehead, hands and other parts of your body. For example if you get the virus under your nails and then bite them, you would get infected with the virus.</li>
